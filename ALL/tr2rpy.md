# tr2rpy
_Convert SO(3) or SE(3) matrix to roll-pitch-yaw angles_


```RPY = TR2RPY(T, options)``` are the roll-pitch-yaw angles (1&times;3)
corresponding to the rotation part of a homogeneous transform `T`. The 3
angles `RPY`=[ROLL,PITCH,YAW] correspond to sequential rotations about the Z, Y and
X axes respectively. Roll and yaw angles are in [-pi,pi) while pitch angle is
in [-pi/2,pi/2).


```RPY = TR2RPY(R, options)``` as above but the input is an orthonormal
rotation matrix `R` (3&times;3).


If `R` (3&times;3&times; K) or `T` (4&times;4&times; K) represent a sequence then each row of `RPY`
corresponds to a step of the sequence.
### Options

| | |
|---|---|
| `'deg'` | Compute angles in degrees (radians default) |



| | |
|---|---|
| `'xyz'` | Return solution for sequential rotations about X, Y, Z axes |
| `'zyx'` | Return solution for sequential rotations about Z, Y, X axes (default) |
| `'yxz'` | Return solution for sequential rotations about Y, X, Z axes |
| `'arm'` | Return solution for sequential rotations about X, Y, Z axes |
| `'vehicle'` | Return solution for sequential rotations about Z, Y, X axes |
| `'camera'` | Return solution for sequential rotations about Y, X, Z axes |


### Notes
* There is a singularity for the case where PITCH=pi/2 in which case ROLL is arbitrarily    set to zero and YAW is the sum (ROLL+YAW).
* Translation component is ignored.
* Toolbox rel 8-9 has XYZ angle sequence as default.
* 'arm', 'vehicle', 'camera' are synonyms for 'xyz', 'zyx' and 'yxz'    respectively.
* these solutions are generated by symbolic/rpygen.mlx
