# Classes

The Spatial Math Toolbox matrix functions, the oldest part of the Toolbox, use native MATLAB matrices to represent position, orientation and pose. However this has a number of limitations:

- there is no type safety, MATLAB allows us to add two SE(2) matrices but that is not a valid operation on the SE(2) group.
- type introspection, a 3&times;3 matrix could represent an SE(2) pose or an SO(3) rotation.
- function names vary depending on whether you are working in 2D or 3D.
- a sequence of poses is a matrix with 3 indices which is notationally clumsy, eg. `T(:,:,i)`.
- for code debugging the type of the object is clearly displayed in the workspace window.

To address these issues the Toolbox introduces a family of classes to represent these important mathematical objects:

        RTBPose (abstract handle class)
           |
           +--SO2
           |   |
           |   +-- SE2
           |
           +--SO3
               |
               +--SE3
           
        UnitQuaternion
        Quaternion
        Twist

The classes, derived from RTBPose, are designed to be substantially backward compatible with the native matrix functions.

## 2D

Many problems in robotics, particularly in mobile robotics, can be considered in terms of position and orientation in the plane.  In 2D:

- position is defined by two quantities, typically denoted _x_ and _y_.
- orientation is defined by one angle, typically denoted &theta;.

### Orientation SO(2)

Orientation in 2D can be represented by an instance object of the `SO2` class which contains internally a 2&times;2 matrices that belong to the special orthogonal group of order 2 which in mathematical shorthand is written as SO(2).  These matrices have special properties:

- determinant equals +1
- inverse is given by the transpose

To create such a matrix representing a rotation of 45 degrees is
```matlab
>> R = SO2(45, 'deg')
R =
    0.7071   -0.7071
    0.7071    0.7071

>> whos R
  Name      Size            Bytes  Class    Attributes
  R         1x1                32  SO2 
```
which is a MATLAB object -- an instance of the SO2 class.  The result appears identical to that obtained using the `rot2` function.

It is important to remember that R is an object not a matrix.  The matrix can be obtained by
```matlab
>> double(R)   % or R.R
ans =
    0.7071   -0.7071
    0.7071    0.7071
>> whos ans
  Name      Size            Bytes  Class     Attributes
  ans       2x2                32  double 
```

We can think of this object as defining a new coordinate frame, rotated counter-clockwise, with respect to the world coordinate frame.  To draw that frame is simply
```matlab
>> R.plot()
```
using C++/Java style dot notation or we can write it in more conventional MATLAB functional notation as
```matlab
>> plot(R)
```

Note that, just as for a 2&times;2 matrix, we can also write 
```matlab
>> trplot2(R)
```
which has the _same_ semantics as would be used with a native MATLAB matrix, but with the added advantage of type safety. In this case `trplot2` is a method of the `SO2` class.

We can animate the motion from the world frame to the rotated frame with
```matlab
>>> R.animate()
```

![Animation produced by tranimate2('movie')](anim2.gif)

We can interpolate between two orientations
```matlab
    R1 = SO2(20, 'deg')
    R2 = SO2(90, 'deg')
    R = interp(R1, R2, 0.5)   % or R1.interp(R2, 0.5)
```
where the 0.5 indicates a rotation half way between the initial and final rotations.  This parameter can vary between 0, which would return `R1` and 1 which would return `R2`.

We can return a sequence of rotation matrices
```matlab
>> R = interp(R1, R2, 0:0.05:1);
>> whos R
  Name      Size              Bytes  Class     Attributes
  R         1x21              672  SO2            
```
which is a sequence of twenty one `SO2` objects smoothly changing from `R1` to `R2`.

Consider a point defined with respect to the frame {A}
```matlab
>> A = SO2(45, 'deg')
A =
    0.7071   -0.7071
    0.7071    0.7071
>> A.plot('frame', 'A')
>> P = [0 1]'
P =
     0
     1
>> plot_point(P, 'label', 'P')
```

![2D coordinate frame and point](frame2d-1.png)
Now the position of the point _with respect to_ the world frame is
```matlab
>> A'*P
ans =
    0.7071
    0.7071
```
which can be easily verified.  In this case the multiplication operator has been overloaded by the `SO2` class.

Note that if we add two `SO2` objects
```matlab
>> A+A
ans =
    1.4142   -1.4142
    1.4142    1.4142
```
the result will not be an `SO2` object because addition is not defined for the SO(2) group. The result will instead be a regular MATLAB matrix.
```matlab
>> whos ans
  Name      Size            Bytes  Class     Attributes
  ans       2x2                32  double
```

Other arithmetic operators are supported, for example
```matlab
>> A^2
ans = 
         0        -1
         1         0
```
is equivalent to `A*A` which represents a rotation of 45deg followed by a rotation of 45deg for a total rotation of 90deg.

```matlab
>> inv(A)
ans = 
    0.7071    0.7071
   -0.7071    0.7071
```
is the inverse of `A` which for an SO(2) matrix is its transpose.

```matlab
>> A/A
ans = 
         1         0
         0         1
```
is the same as `A*inv(A)` which is the identity matrix as expected.

Logical operators are also supported, eg.
```matlab
>> A==A
ans =
  logical
   1
```
which tests for equality between all the matrix elements.

Finally, sometimes for the purposes of example it is nice to have a random rotation matrix
```matlab
>> SO2.rand
ans = 
    0.6861   -0.7275
    0.7275    0.6861
```

### Pose SE(2)

To represent position (as well as rotation) we use an instance object of the `SE2` class which contains internally a 3&tmes;3 homogeneous transformation matrix.  To represent a displacement of 2 in the x-direction and 3 in the y-direction is simply
```matlab
>> T = SE2(2, 3)
T =
     1     0     2
     0     1     3
     0     0     1
```
which represents the pose of a coordinate frame which we can show graphically by
```matlab
>> T.plot()   % or plot(T)
```

![2D coordinate frame and point](frame2d-2.png)

We can extract the translational component by
```matlab
>> T.t
ans =
     2
     3
```

Note that for compatability purposes we could also use the `transl2` method.

Now in the general case, the coordinate frame attached to our object of interest will have an arbitrary translation and rotation which can be specified in the constructor as
```matlab
>> SE2(2, 3, 30, 'deg')    % or SE2( [2 3 30], 'deg')
ans = 
    0.8660   -0.5000         2
    0.5000    0.8660         3
         0         0         1
```
which is a translation by 2 in the x-direction and 3 in the y-direction _then_ a rotation by 30 degrees.

![2D coordinate frame and point](frame2d-5.png)

Consider a point defined with respect to the frame {A}
```matlab
>> A.plot('frame', 'A')
>> P = [2 4]'
P =
     2
     4
>> plot_point(P, 'label', 'P')
```
which is shown above

Now the position of the point _with respect to_ the world frame is
```matlab
>> inv(A)*P
ans =
    0.5000
    0.8660
```
which is a Euclidean vector.  Note that the `SE2` class has done all the work of  is simply the first two elements, and this result can be easily verified from the figure above.

## 3D

Many problems in physics and robotics involve objects in everyday 3D space.
For this we need to consider the more complicated case of orientation in 3D

- position is defined by 3 quantities, typically denoted _x_, _y_ and _z_.
- orientation is defined by 3 angles, and there many options for denoting these.


### Orientation SO(3)

Orientation in 3D can be represented by a subset of 3x3 matrices that belong to the special orthogonal group of order 3 which in mathematical shorthand is written as SO(3).  These matrices have special properties:

- determinant equals +1
- inverse is given by the transpose

```matlab
>> R = SO3.Rx(45, 'deg')
R =
    1.0000         0         0
         0    0.7071   -0.7071
         0    0.7071    0.7071

>> whos R
  Name      Size            Bytes  Class     Attributes
  R         1x1                72  SO3              
```
which is a MATLAB object -- an instance of the SO3 class.  The result is appears identical to that obtained using the `rotx` function.

We can think of this object as defining a new coordinate frame, rotated about the world coordinate frame's x-axis.  To draw that frame is simply

```matlab
>> R.plot()    % or plot(R)
```

![2D coordinate frame and point](frame3d-1.png)

or animate the motion from the world frame to the rotated frame with
```matlab
>> R.animate()    % or animate(R)
```

![Animation produced by tranimate('movie')](anim3d-1.gif)
and since we are rotating about the x-axis it doesn't move.

Just as for the 2D-case we can interpolate between two orientations
```matlab
>> R1 = SO3.Rx(20, 'deg')
>> R2 = SO3.Ry(90, 'deg')
>> R = interp(R1, R2, 0.5)    % or R1.interp(R2, 0.5)
```
where the 0.5 indicates a rotation half way between the initial and final rotations.  This parameter can vary between 0, which would return `R1` and 1 which would return `R2`.

We can return a sequence of rotation matrices
```matlab
>> R = interp(R1, R2, 0:0.05:1);    % or R1.interp(R2, 0:0.05:1)
>> whos R
  Name      Size              Bytes  Class     Attributes

  R         1x21             1512  SO3  
```
which is a sequence of twenty one `SO3` orientation objects smoothly changing from `R1` to `R2`.
