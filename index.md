# Introduction

The Spatial Math Toolbox for MATLAB (SMTB) is free software that provides extensive capabilities to represent position, orientation and pose in 2D and 3D.

This Toolbox underpins the [Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB](http://www.petercorke.com/robot) and the [Machine Vision Toolbox for MATLAB](http://www.petercorke.com/vision).

SMTB supports two different representations:

1. [Using MATLAB matrices](matrix.html).  This has been part of the toolbox for over 20 years and is powerful yet efficient.
2. [Using MATLAB classes](class.html).  This is a more recent capabilty, and trades off some efficiency for readability and type safety.
