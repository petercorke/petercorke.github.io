# This is a heading

And here is some *emphasised* and _strong_ text.

  1. Lists are great in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
  2. You just start typing and they appear.
  3. Your code looks just like the output.
  4. Nested lists work too:
    * This one's unordered.
    * Just like you would when you're hashing out notes.
    * Very little thinking required.
